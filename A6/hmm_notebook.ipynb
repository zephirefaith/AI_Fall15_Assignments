    "In a recent trip to Switzerland, you discover the Swiss Alp Horn - used for remote villages to\n",
    "communicate between the different Alps. This large horn is difficult to play for beginners, and you\n",
    "discover you can make about 4 notes on it - badly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't feel so bad - an expert alp horn player isn't very reliable either. However, by playing different\n",
    "progression of tones, different messsages can be conveyed across the Swiss valleys. For example, a\n",
    "wavering high and low series of notes indicates danger of avalanche. However, a more drawn-out tune\n",
    "which starts high and ends low indicates danger of invasion. For simplicity, assume that the horn is expected to make one of three sounds: high, mid and low.\n",
    "\n",
    "You befriend a villager, whose job it is to stay up all night and listen for these faint\n",
    "sounds - alerting the village whenever there is danger. However, the villager is not very reliable\n",
    "because he keeps falling asleep. You decide to make a computer program to listen for the alerts and\n",
    "automatically decide which alarm to give depending on which alert is heard.\n",
    "\n",
    "After much trial and error, you determine that the HMMs below are appropriate to the task. The output\n",
    "distributions are discrete, indicating the four separate notes that are supposed to be played. We assume\n",
    "the prior probabilities of avalanche and invasion are identical."
